This document outlines the plan for creating a web-based vulnerability logging and tracking tool. The project will be developed using a modern technology stack and deployed as a Docker container, making it easy to set up and run.

1. Project Overview and Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly dashboard for logging and tracking security vulnerabilities. This tool will provide a centralized platform for security teams to manage vulnerabilities, track their status, and ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.

Key Goals:

Centralized Vulnerability Management: A single place to record and manage all identified vulnerabilities.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive dashboard that is easy to navigate and use.

Secure User Authentication: A login system to ensure that only authorized users can access the tool.

User Management: The ability for an admin to add and remove users.

Containerized Deployment: The application will be packaged as a Docker image for easy deployment and scalability.

2. Technology Stack
The project will be built using the following technologies:

Frontend:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

shadcn/ui: A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components.

Vite: A fast and modern build tool for web development.

Backend:

Node.js with Express: A lightweight and flexible web framework for building the backend API.

PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database for storing vulnerability and user data.

Containerization:

Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Version Control:

Git and GitHub: For source code management and collaboration.

3. Core Features
The initial version of the tool will focus on the following core features:

User Authentication:

A login page for users to authenticate.

A default admin account for initial setup.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

Dashboard:

A main dashboard to display a list of all logged vulnerabilities.

The ability to view key details of each vulnerability, such as severity, status, and date reported.

Vulnerability Management:

A form to add new vulnerabilities with details like name, description, severity, and status.

The ability to edit and update existing vulnerabilities.

The ability to delete vulnerabilities.

User Management (Admin Only):

A separate section in the dashboard for the admin to manage users.

The ability to add new users with a username and password.

The ability to remove existing users.

4. Project Phases and Timeline
I recommend breaking down the project into the following phases to make it more manageable:

Phase 1: Project Setup and Backend (1-2 weeks)

[ ] Set up the project repository on GitHub.

[ ] Create the project structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend.

[ ] Set up the Docker environment with docker-compose.yml for the backend and Postgres database.

[ ] Design the database schema for vulnerabilities and users.

[ ] Implement the backend API with endpoints for user authentication and CRUD operations for vulnerabilities.

Phase 2: Frontend Development and Dashboard (2-3 weeks)

[ ] Set up the React project with Vite and shadcn/ui.

[ ] Create the login page and implement the authentication flow.

[ ] Build the main dashboard to display vulnerabilities from the backend.

[ ] Create the forms for adding and editing vulnerabilities.

[ ] Implement the user management interface for the admin.

Phase 3: Integration and Deployment (1 week)

[ ] Connect the frontend to the backend API.

[ ] Thoroughly test the application to ensure all features are working as expected.

[ ] Create a Dockerfile for the frontend to build a production-ready image.

[ ] Write a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the project using Docker Compose.

[ ] Publish the Docker image to Docker Hub for easy distribution.

5. Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed using Docker, which provides a consistent and reproducible environment.

Local Development: Use docker-compose up to run the entire application stack (frontend, backend, and database) on your local machine.

Production Deployment: The application can be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean). You can run the application on a single server or use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes for more advanced deployments.
